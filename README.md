Code for the revising manuscript, Zhang et al., Ice Modeling Indicates Formation Mechanisms of Large-scale Folding in Greenland’s Ice Sheet
Large-scale stratigraphic folds have been universally observed in the ice-penetrating radargrams of Greenland’s ice sheet. 
Here we use the full-Stokes code Underworld to simulate ice movements in three-dimensional convergent flow, mainly concerning ice anisotropy due to crystallographic preferred orientation (CPO), vertical viscosity and density contrasts in ice layers, and bedrock conditions.
Model 1: isotropic ice, free-slip basal boundary
Model 2: anisotropic ice, free slip
Model 3: anisotropy, flat bedrock surface
Model 4: anisotropy, bumpy bedrock surface (400m)
Model 5: isotropy, bumpy bedrock surface (400m)
Model 6: larger anisotropy based on Model 4
Model 7: anisotropy, bumpy bedrock surface (200m)
Model 8: larger bumps based on Model 4
Model 9: larger ice thickness based on Model 4
Model 10: larger model size
